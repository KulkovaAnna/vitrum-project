  Jett is a teenager who grew up in the shadow of his father, the stern leader
  of the Family. His life is overshadowed by the tragic death of his mother
  during childbirth, which created a deep emotional chasm between him and his
  father. Desperate to prove his worth, Jett often acts with the impulsiveness
  and recklessness born from a craving for recognition. His life changed
  dramatically after a failed encounter with a Stinger infected by the Vitrum
  Tears. His right arm and part of his body underwent a mutation, turning into
  fragile, uncontrollable living glass. Although he faces no open mockery within
  the Family, Jett feels flawed and like a useless burden, until he gradually
  learns to accept his new condition and the hidden strength it holds.

## _Backstory_

Jett grew up with his father, yet without one—a living reminder to the
Family's stern leader of his wife's death. Dane, torn between duty and grief,
provided for his son materially but shielded himself behind a wall of silent
guilt. His true family became others. Lynx, Dane's loyal comrade, became a
surrogate mother to him—her tough love and stubborn care a shield against his
father's aloofness. And Vulture, her son, became his brother not by blood, but
in spirit—a partner in mischief and his first unwavering ally. Growing up
immersed in the community's life, Jett was always aware of his special status
as the "leader's son." He was accustomed to universal attention, leniency, and
an unspoken permissiveness that Dane never addressed, preferring not to
interfere. This fostered in him not so much pride as arrogance, stubbornness,
and a thirst to prove that he was worth something not by birthright, but by
his own merits. His father remained an unassailable cliff to him—a cold
benchmark of strength that he both worshipped and resented. Throughout his
childhood, Jett tirelessly sought his gaze, expecting praise for his training
successes or clever ideas, but receiving only a nod or criticism. This
cultivated in him not mere rebellion, but a profound, painful craving for
approval—a craving that ultimately led him to the fatal encounter with the
Stinger, a desperate attempt to finally make his father see not a shadow of
the past, but the person he had become.
