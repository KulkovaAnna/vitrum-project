<CharacterPageInfoBlock label="Short Description" id="char-short-description">
  Fox is the embodiment of a cynical survivor in the cruel world of the
  wasteland. His red hair and amber, predatory eyes reflect his foxy nature:
  cautious, observant, and always ready to strike. He is an experienced scout
  and a skilled marksman, his movements honed by years of struggle. Secretive
  and silent, he prefers to observe and listen rather than engage in
  conversation. Behind his mask of cynicism lies a deep vulnerability; he fears
  trust, betrayal, and his own growing attachment to those he protects. His
  greatest battle is not with the Jesters, but with himself—a conflict between
  his ingrained habit of seeing threats everywhere and a longing for something
  genuine, which surfaces in quiet moments by the campfire or in the trembling
  line of chalk on a wall. Even his name is more than an alias; it is his
  essence: a predator prowling in the darkness who, against all odds, sometimes
  allows himself to believe in warmth.

## _Backstory_

<Spoiler>
  The origins of Fox are shrouded in mystery. All that is known is that at the
  age of five, he was sold to slave traders by his mother. He spent seven long
  years in chains until he miraculously gained his freedom one day. The
  following four years of wandering the wastelands hardened him: he survived
  through theft, trusted no one, formed no attachments, and never stayed in one
  place for longer than a month. His fate changed when he tried to steal
  supplies from the Family—a local raider gang. He was caught red-handed by Dane
  himself. However, instead of punishment, the stranger offered him something
  unimaginable: a place among them and a new name. He didn't lecture him or
  demand oaths, only work for the common good. Fox, accustomed to betrayal, met
  this luck with the deepest suspicion. But soon he realized that Dane was a man
  whose words matched his deeds. Wanting to justify the trust placed in him, Fox
  began serving the community devotedly, and his loyalty did not go unnoticed.
  Dane highly valued his loyalty and insight, seeing in him a valuable fighter.
  Over the next nine years, Fox rose from a thief to the head of intelligence,
  earning universal recognition. And although he earned his status with blood
  and sweat, deep down he still doubts whether he truly deserves it all.
