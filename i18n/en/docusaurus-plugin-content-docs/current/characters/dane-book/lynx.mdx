  Lynx is the embodiment of harsh, almost primal strength and maternal devotion.
  Behind her appearance, which brings to mind a weary but unbreakable she-bear,
  lies an iron will and a deep, rarely shown tenderness for those she considers
  family. She is a woman who has passed through hell and built her home on its
  doorstep, a home she will defend with the fury of a wounded beast.

## _Backstory_

<p>
  Lynx remembers no life before the Pack. Thrown into the gang as a child, she
  quickly learned its prime law: the strong prey on the weak. To survive among
  sadists and scum, she became still as still water and sharper than a steel
  trap. She cared nothing for drugs or power — only survival. She became the
  perfect tool: emotionless, efficient, and forgettable, the one they sent on
  the "quiet" jobs.
</p>
<p>
  She was never the life of the party. While other raiders caroused, she did her
  work, melting into the shadows.
</p>
<Spoiler>
  <p>
    But in her role as a ghost, she became the only one who saw the whole
    picture. She watched as Dane, the Pack's most ferocious beast, broke and
    became Grim's puppet. And she watched, holding her breath, as he, sickened
    by his own reflection, chose to chain himself. This act was so alien to
    everything she knew that it made her, for the first time, not just look, but
    see. Later, she witnessed how the fragile Francine managed to reach the
    chained beast. And against all odds, it worked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her decision to leave with Dane was not born of a sudden belief in good. It
    was a cold, strategic calculation. The Pack was rotting from within, a
    sinking ship. Dane, even broken, was a force of nature, and his method —
    sheer, unyielding will — had proven itself. In a new order built on
    structure, someone like her—efficient and unshakably loyal — was a valuable
    asset, a key to stability.
  </p>
</Spoiler>
<p>
  It was only after leaving that she discovered she was pregnant. The news did
  not shatter her; it transmuted into a final trial. In the Pack, a child was a
  liability. In her new world, her son would be a living testament to strength.
  The strength of her choice, the strength of their Family, the strength of life
  defying a world of death.
</p>
<p>
  Now, Lynx is a shadow no longer. She is a cornerstone. Living proof that even
  from chaos, something unyielding can be forged. And she defends this legacy
  not with a shadow's silence, but with the long-stored fury of a lifetime.
