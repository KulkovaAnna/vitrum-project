## _Backstory_

<Spoiler>
  <p>
    Her real name is Beatrice Javier. It remained in the sterile corridors of
    the "Theta" bunker, along with her past life — a life that felt more like a
    long, meticulously planned workday.
  </p>
  <p>
    She was a product of the Iron Order system — a top student in her studies, a
    perfect soldier in training, a competent medic in the infirmary. Her
    abilities were noticed. The officer assigned as her curator was Vladislav
    Rudnitsky from the External Surveillance Department — a man with a cold mind
    and an impeccable service record. Their marriage was a logical career step
    for both. For him, it was a chance to gain control over one of the most
    promising agents. For her, it was access to missions outside the bunker.
    They treated each other with professional respect, without a hint of
    personal attachment. It was a union of like-minded individuals who perfectly
    understood the rules of the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    She was assigned to the Vestibule, Sector 9. Call sign: "Reese". Her
    mission: observation. She was to become the eyes and ears of the Iron Order
    in this settlement of "savages," tracking any changes that could disrupt the
    fragile balance or pose a threat to Vitrum research. She diligently sent
    reports; her data was flawless.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everything changed when the Family arrived in the Vestibule. The neutral
    observation zone instantly turned into an enemy camp. The protocol dictated
    one thing: "scorched earth." Liquidate the equipment. Liquidate herself.
    Leave nothing for the enemy.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the last moment, violating all instructions, she contacted Rudnitsky. She
    proposed a strategy — not destruction, but infiltration. She hoped his
    analytical mind would appreciate this chance, that he, as her commander and
    husband, would see her not as expendable, but as a strategic asset.
  </p>
  <p>
    The response was immediate. Without hesitation. Rudnitsky's voice was as
    even and impersonal as always: "The order stands. Protocol 'Scorched Earth.'
    No exceptions. You are a resource. Do not allow the resource to be
    compromised. Rudnitsky, out."
  </p>
  <p>
    Those words crossed out everything. The system, and the man who personified
    it for her, had disavowed her. She did not follow the order. When Jett found
    her in the basement, Beatrice Javier ceased to exist. Only Reese remained —
    a deserter with a single goal: to survive and one day make the Iron Order
    regret they saw her as nothing but expendable.
