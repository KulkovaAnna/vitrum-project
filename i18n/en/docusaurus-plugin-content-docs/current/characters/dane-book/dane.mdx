<CharacterPageInfoBlock label="Short Description" id="char-short-description">
  Dane is the pragmatic leader and founder of the Family, a community surviving
  in the harsh Glass Wasteland. A strong-willed, cold, and incredibly
  responsible strategist, he controls every aspect of his community's life, from
  defense to resource distribution. His decisions are always weighed and devoid
  of sentiment, as the price of a mistake is the death of those who have trusted
  him. Behind this iron exterior lies a deep, almost unspoken care for his
  people and his teenage son, whose desire to prove his maturity Dane
  simultaneously encourages and warily restrains. He is the living embodiment of
  the heavy price of survival, a man who chose to build a fortress of rules and
  duty to never again succumb to the chaos that once nearly destroyed him.

## _Backstory_

<Spoiler>
  <p>
    Dane's origins are lost to the chaos of the Wasteland's early years. Thrown
    into the apocalypse as a child, he knew no law but the right of the strong
    and had no goal other than survival. His cruelty and fury became his only
    shield against a hostile world.
  </p>
  <p>
    He found his natural environment in the Pack — a gang that valued strength
    and aggression above all. Given the nickname "Wolf," he found in it both a
    home and a calling, surrendering completely to chaos and violence. Drugs
    amplified his power, and Grim, a new comrade, encouraged his darkest
    impulses, seeing them as an art form. Dane didn't concern himself with
    morality — he enjoyed feeling like a god of destruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everything collapsed during the raid on the Iron Gates. Drunk on rage and
    chemicals, he crossed every line, unleashing a massacre where there was no
    distinction between friend and foe. Waking up in a sea of blood, he realized
    in horror what he had become. He voluntarily put on a chain, shackling not
    only his body but also the beast within—a symbol of his total rejection of
    his former path.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the main catalyst for his transformation was Francine — a quiet and
    vulnerable girl who had come to the Pack with Grim. Her strangeness, purity,
    and difference from others made Dane see that there was more to the world
    than just chaos. She was not afraid of his rage, seeing the man behind it,
    and with her calmness and directness, she showed him that a different way of
    life was possible. For her, he finally broke with his past, vowing to
    protect with the strength of order, not the strength of destruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fleeing the Pack with those who remained loyal, he took Francine with him.
    With her, he built a new life based on order, discipline, and harsh
    responsibility. Thus, the Family was born: not a gang, but a fortress where
    his iron will became a shield for others. He did not forget who he was. He
    simply made sure to remember who he never wanted to be again.
